Random Module

#take two number int 
randint(a,b)  #a is start number and b is end number   a<=x<=b
    example:
    import random
    a=random.randint(1,90)
    print(a)
    >>>17

                #different between randint and randrange is randint(a<=x<=b) both have aqual but randrange(a<=x<b) bot do not have aqual
#it will take two int number
randrange(a,b)  #a is start number and b is end number    a<=x<b
    example:
    import random
    a=random.randrange(1,3)
    print(a)
    >>>1
    >>>2     #it will not take out 3

#it is also a function with containt floating numbers
random()      #0.0<=x<1.0  which containt 0.0 but not containt 1.0 beacuse it will take lesser than it (0.999999) 
    example:
    import random
    a=random.random()
    print(a)
    >>>0.02256284558594157      #it will take out number between 0.0 and 1.0 but it will not contain 1.0 
    >>>0.02256284558594157

#it will take both int and float number but resuilt is allways float

    example:
    import random
    a=random.uniform(1,5)  #int
    print(a)
    >>>3.0449453481913045

    print(a
    >>>1.463051959273634
    >>>1.9269746013599023

#it choice from list one thing for from a bandle of somthing it will chioce

    example:
    import random
    a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8]

#it will change the place of list items randomly
