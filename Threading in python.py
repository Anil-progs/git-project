Thread:
#we wana use threads for speed and excute our program concurrently
#Thread: part of a process

start(): begin th execution of new thread or process
join(): wait for a thread or process to complete

#it has less error handling
#it is deffecult for synchronization

#it will let only one Thread to excute in one time
#in python instade of multithreading , we will use from multi processing
#Resource Sharing: As we know that threads can share the memory of global variable. So,
# operation perform by a thread can cause problems to other threads.

different between multi threading and multi processess

>>>Thread will get less memory than process
>>>To many thread will take one part os memory internal of process but each process will take it own memory and thwy will not share 
their memory for each other
>>>multi threading is limites due to GIL(global interperter lock) but multi process achieves true parallelisem

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi processess
